# TensorFlow-object-detection-_-MiniProj

## TensorFlow Object detection API 
    
1. Here we have used the ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite 320x320 for object detection
2. The pretrained models are cloned and imported from [tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) 
3. We use the tensorflow_gpu - 2.9.1 along with CUDA 11.2 version and CUDNN 8.1.0 compatible with corresponding CUDA

### Procedure (Windows):- 
     
 * First we install all the dependencies regarding the project onto a virtual env "tensorflow" by    
   running this on cmd
